Little Bo Peep is a simple 1-player game written in vanilla JavaScript that plays out on a rectangular canvas. Sheep fall from the top of the screen either on the left or right side. The player's goal is to catch these sheep before they hit the bottom of the screen by using their left and right arrow keys to trigger a crook to reach out and catch them. As the player captures more sheep, the sheep begin to fall at faster speeds. The game continues until a sheep reaches the bottom of the screen.
